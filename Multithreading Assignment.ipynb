    "Q1) What is multithreading in python? Why is it used? Name the module used to handle threads in python\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. Multithreading in python refers to running of smaller units of program within the same process. It is used to obtain concurrency and to obtain efficiency as cpu is always busy in doing some tasks and not sitting idle at times like I/O operations, it is doing some background tasks. The module use to handle threads in python is 'threading'."

    "    Concurrency: Multithreading allows threads to run concurrently on a single cpu core.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Resource Sharing: Threads are sub tasks of a process which share the same memory space and resources. This allows easier communication and exchange of information between threads.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Responsiveness: Threads help in increasing the responsiveness of the program or an app as there are always some tasks running in the background which allows the flow of work to be as smooth as possible.\n",

    "Ans. \n",
    "\n",
    "A deadlock is a condition in concurrent programming which occurs when supposedly two threads are waiting for some resource to complete its execution but are not able to get the resource as the two threads are also occupying the resource which other thread needs.\n",
    "For a deadlock to happen, the following 4 conditions need to occur simultaneously:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Hold and Wait: The thread must be holding onto one resource while waiting for other resource to be freed.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Circular Wait: There should exist a cycle between threads like if thread1 is occupying resource 1 and waiting for resource 2 then thread2 must be occupying resource 2 and waiting for resource 1\n",
    "    \n",
    "    No preemption: There should be no release of resource by threads just becuase its time quantum is over. There should be no concept of preemption\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Mutual Exclusion: Threads should have mutually exclusive control over a resource. That is one resource could be used by only one thread at a time.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Race condition\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Race condition occurs when two or more threads are accessing a shared data and at least one of them has the capability to change it. This will cause unpredictability in the output while reading the data."
